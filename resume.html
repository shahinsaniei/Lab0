            <p>Nonlinear Behavior Of Fixed Oﬀshore Platform Under Environmental Loads.</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The aim of my research was to analyze the behavior and demand of elements of
              a structure in order to reach an optimized design. For this purpose, I modeled a case study
              oﬀshore platform using Macro method. Simulating the designed load conditions, this structure
              was analyzed using Distributed Plasticity method as well as the time history dynamic loading.
              Various software including SACS and OpenSees were utilized to perform nonlinear analysis.
              However, to accomplish the project I developed a software using C# programming language
              which decodes SACS complicated 3D model and remodel it by TCL programming somehow can
              be usable in OpenSees platform for further nonlinear analysis.</p>

                <p><strong>Ecological Revitalization,</strong> in this research I studied applying bioremediation processes by using
                  microorganisms to improve contaminated area by hydrocarbon materials is a cost-eﬀective, safe
                  natural-based and practical method. The microorganism grows by consumption of available
                  hydrocarbon of contaminated area and produces carbon dioxide, water and methane, and sometimes
                  less toxicity. This study introduced the potentials of biodegradation methods of contaminated soil.</p>

                    designed a recreational port with 100 buoys capacity. The project included locating the best area for
                    constructing the project in the island, locating breakwater and basin design, designing a breakwater
                    and selecting the type, location and location of the quay. I applied MIKE21 software to do this
                    project.</p>

                      tered with, in this project I reviewed Cathodic method as one of the most prominent ways to protect
                      oﬀshore and onshore structures against corrosion. Sacriﬁce Anode and induction current were the</p>
                      <p><strong> Designing an Open-type Wharf for 80000 Tons,</strong> in this project I utilized the SAP2000 software
                        for modelling and structural analysis. By considering the speciﬁed dead and live load I determined
                        the pile design forces and also I calculated mooring energy and wind load to determine a proper
                        fender and bollard.</p>

                          element software. After loading the model by gravity and environmental loads static analysis was
                          done and reports of the Stress unity check and displacements of the model elements and nodes
                          were presented.</p>
