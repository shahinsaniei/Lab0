            Construction has been running in my family over four generations. When I was six years old, my father gifted me his white engineering helmet that he was using in his construction projects, and it was the start point of my interest in civil engineering. The majority of my childhood was spent in several construction projects with my father. Presence among engineers and executives led to the unintentional visit of multiple projects throughout the country.
         My childhood memory and family history were a great inspiration to start my undergraduate study in Surveying Engineering. In 2007, I enrolled in Bachelor of Science in surveying engineering in Southern Tehran Azad University. This program, through its many operational courses, made a contribution to improve my spirit of teamwork and leadership.
        In 2014, in parallel with my professional career, I enrolled in MSc in Civil Engineering-Marine Structures at Amirkabir University (Tehran Polytechnic).
        While I was playing prominent role in my position as technical lead, I passed my dissertation with honored under the supervision of one of the most knowledgeable university professors who is also the faculty dean. The project was about nonlinear behavior of fixed steel offshore platform under environmental loads.
        After graduating in masterâ€™s degree in 2017 I gained a scientific and deeper understanding about construction in addition to my practical experiences. It makes me eager to utilize Geomatics Engineering particularly in construction project as a traditional partner in building sector.
